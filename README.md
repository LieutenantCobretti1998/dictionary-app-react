# Frontend Mentor - Dictionary web app

![Design preview for the Dictionary web app coding challenge](preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The Dictionary Web App is a mini portfolio project that I built using React with a focus on integrating a third-party API for real-time data fetching. This was my first project written in vanilla React.
In this project I tried to understand how react works behind the scenes, how implement logically some optimization techniques such as memoization and also unserstand the logic behind react context api.

**What I Learned:**
1. Practical implementation of API integration in a React app.
2. Managing state and props in React. React Context API and optimization techniques. Understanding of props flow through the components and as the result, the whole app architecture
3. Handling form validation in a user-friendly manner.
4. Creating a responsive and accessible UI.

**Tech Stack**
  **Frontend:**
      React: Used to build the user interface with reusable components and efficient state management.
  **API Integration:**
    Free Dictionary API: Fetched definitions, phonetics, and audio files for searched words in real time.
  **Development Tools:**
    Vite.js: A modern build tool for faster development and hot module replacement.
    WebStorm: Code editor with extensions for enhanced productivity.
    Git: Version control to track changes and collaborate.
    GitHub: Repository hosting for code management and sharing.
  **Deployment:**
    Netlify: Hosted the live version of the application with continuous deployment from GitHub.
  **Others:**
    Responsive Design Techniques: Ensured the app works seamlessly on all screen sizes.
    Browser Compatibility: Verified consistent performance across major browsers.
